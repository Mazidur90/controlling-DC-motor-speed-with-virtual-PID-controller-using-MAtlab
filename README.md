The step response of System 3 was recorded and was identified as a first order system (PT1) .A linear system (series connection of System 3 and System 2) was to be 
controlled with the help of P, PI and PID controllers. The controllers were 
implemented as Simulink block diagrams. The very small overshoot and 
negligibly small amplitude of oscillation
